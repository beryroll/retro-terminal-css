# 80s RETRO Terminal CSS
## welcome
hey there I'm a tech enthusiast who's had a recent obsession with 80s terminals and hard technology. my OCD wouldn't let me work without a little tinkering... and that tinkering has brought me here.
I'm not adept at coding, but I needed my brain's itch scratched, so I had to go to ChatGPT. After the basic code, and a lot of petty-brained refinements I had to fix in the generated code, this is the final result!
## installation
**no need to download the file!**
just ensure you have these prerequisites:
- a browser that supports extensions (chrome, firefox, etc.)
- the **[stylus](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne?hl=en)** chrome extension
- and some fair knowledge of CSS (no worries if you don't! you can ask ChatGPT or any other AI of choice)
## setup
1. view the raw file
2. copy the css
3. go to stylus → manage → (+) symbol
4. select 'everything' in the dropdown for where the css will be applicable
5. paste the css
6. hit cmd/ctrl + s
done! :) enjoy your new terminal-themed sites, and tweak in the CSS to your whims!
